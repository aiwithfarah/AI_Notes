# PyPI (Python Package Index): Think of this as the "App Store" for Python code.
# It is a Massive Online Repository of Python packages
# PIP: This is the tool we use to download from that store
# IMPORTANT: You do NOT write pip install inside your Python script (the .py file).
#  You type it in your Terminal (Command Prompt)
